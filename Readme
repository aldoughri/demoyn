-by default DAO can returned as JSON

- owner ORM is can be delicate as ENUM in database



- @PreAuthorize annotation take roleVoter
        <value>
            ROLE_ADMIN > ROLE_STAFF
            ROLE_STAFF > ROLE_USER
            ROLE_USER > ROLE_GUEST
        </value>

- @Transactional annotation by default If no rules are relevant to the exception
it will be treated like DefaultTransactionAttribute
(rolling back on RuntimeException and Error but not on checked exceptions).

-Create update queries with the Spring Data JPA @Query annotation

-Solution for cancel editing transaction:
public abstract boolean clearAutomatically
Defines whether we should clear the underlying persistence context after executing the modifying query.

- Select ist<> don't accept in  query
- in repository define method is like select query with filtering
- we can define update query method

-some annotation use for:
@Configuration: Used to indicate that a class declares one or more @Bean methods. These classes are processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime.
@ComponentScan: Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes. Here we can specify the base packages to scan for spring components.
@Component: Indicates that an annotated class is a “component”. Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.
@Service: Indicates that an annotated class is a “Service”. This annotation serves as a specialization of @Component, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.
@Repository: Indicates that an annotated class is a “Repository”. This annotation serves as a specialization of @Component and advisable to use with DAO classes.
@Autowired: Spring @Autowired annotation is used for automatic injection of beans. Spring @Qualifier annotation is used in conjunction with Autowired to avoid confusion when we have two of more bean configured for same type.
and Spring MVC Annotations.
